        "The simulation runs for `NUM_TIMEPERIODS`. At each time period all of the members of each species calls the `food_oracle` inorder for everyone to `gather_all_food`. After all food is collected we can `update_all_populations` based on the amount of food gathered. In order to do so we need to first `compute_local_population_share` which is the percentage of all species WITHIN A SINGLE REGION that belong to a given species. We can then use that to `update_community_population` for each community of each species based on 3 rules as listed in later sections of this document."
